# Dynamic Programming
* Exactly as in the Fibonacci problem, you shouldn't write it recursively : 
	1. Start by identifying the recurrence relation.
	2. Make optimization 1 (Top Down DP) by adding memorization to the recursion.
	3. Make optimization 2 (Bottom Up DP) by converting the recursion to iteration.
	4. Optimization 3 (Fine Tuning) by reducing O(n) space to O(1).
